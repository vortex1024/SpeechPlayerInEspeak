#  what is it?
Speech Player in eSpeak, as known as the Edward voice,  is the integration of the Speech player synthesizer code into eSpeak, which was done by Jake Gross. Due to some bugs, the integration was reverted, and vanilla eSpeak does not include speech player anymore. This addon uses an espeak version which does. I took an espeak build with speech player, renamed a few things so it wouldn't clash with the eSpeak included in NVDA, and packaged it into an addon. It works only with NVDA 2021.1
#building
